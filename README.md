#ABOUT

Foreign languages open borders and provide new opportunities.
Our brain remembers what it encounters frequently.
Once, I was sitting and thinking how great it would be to have a program that repeats foreign words aloud — and specifically those words that are most commonly used in everyday conversation.
As a result, I created such a program.

I started with dictionaries for English and German.
All dictionaries were compiled from subtitles of over 400 videos on various topics.
The program features machine-generated voice output, so it’s not always perfect.
But if your goal is to learn a language, you’ll notice results within a week.
After all, the key to learning is repetition.

The app interface is designed as a step-by-step guide.
If you read and follow everything in order, you’ll quickly understand how to use the app.

I know that products like this are made for intelligent people — and such people are always fewer than the general majority.
However, I truly hope that you are among the smart ones, and that this app will be very useful to you.

Just try using the app for 1 hour a day over the course of a week.
Find your own pattern of using it.
Don’t give up, and you’ll succeed.
