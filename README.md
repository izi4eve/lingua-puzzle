#ABOUT

Foreign languages open borders and provide new opportunities.
Our brain remembers what it encounters frequently.
Once, I was sitting and thinking how great it would be to have a program that repeats foreign words aloud — and specifically those words that are most commonly used in everyday conversation.
As a result, I created such a program.

I started with dictionaries for English and German.
All dictionaries were compiled from subtitles of over 400 videos on various topics.
The program features machine-generated voice output, so it’s not always perfect.
But if your goal is to learn a language, you’ll notice results within a week.
After all, the key to learning is repetition.
